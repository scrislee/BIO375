summary(lionRegression)

# Add the least squares regression line to the plot. The quick method is to use abline. If needed, redraw the scatter plot first. 

abline(lionRegression)

# Another way to draw the regression line is to generate predicted values and then connect them with a line (Figure 17.1-4). This has the advantage of more control - for example, we can make sure that the line doesn't fall outside the range of the data, avoiding extrapolation. Commands to accomplish this are here.

The predict function calculates the corresponding predicted mean y-values on the regression line, as well as the lower and upper limits of the confidence intervals for the predicted mean y-values at each x-value (these are put into the data frame named ypt. Finally, the lines functions connect the consecutive lower limits of the confidence intervals with a line, and do the same for the consecutive upper limits, forming the bands.
