# Calculate odds ratio using the epitools package. Install the package if you haven't already done so (this needs to be done just once per computer, after you've installed R). To use, load the epitools package (this needs to be done just once per R session).

# install.packages("epitools", dependencies = TRUE)

# The formulas for the odds ratio and relative risk in the book assume that the contingency table has a layout exactly like cancerTable, namely

#            treatment control
#  sick          a        b
#  healthy       c        d

# This layout works for the oddsratio function.

oddsratio(cancerTable, method = "wald")

# The resulting output of oddsratio includes a lot of incidental computations. To get clean output only for the odds ratio, including the 95% confidence interval, use the following instead.

oddsratio(cancerTable, method = "wald")$measure[-1,]

# Calculate relative risk using the epitools package. The layout expected by the riskratio function is the complete opposite of the layout used in the book. To use the command with a contingency table in book style (such as cancerTable), we need to flip (transpose) the table and reverse the order of the rows. We can do this all at once with the following arguments to the riskratio function.

library(epitools)
riskratio(t(cancerTable), rev = "both", method = "wald")

# Notice that the result differs slightly from the relative risk value given in the book for these same data (1.007) because rounding error here is reduced. 
# For clean output only for the relative risk, including the 95% confidence interval, use the following command:

riskratio(t(cancerTable), method = "wald", rev = "both")$measure[-1,]

# For step-by-step calculations of the relative risk, see here.
